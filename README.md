# ToneXLib

These are CSV files which you can import into your ToneX library.db using an SQL editor like SQLiteBrowser.

When you import the table into your library.db it is important the table is named ToneModels
In the advanced tab select Replace Existing Row, or Ignore Row under "Conflict Strategy"

When you are done hit the Write Changes button.

These files are an exhaustive list of the models between the dates specified, I reccomend opening them in excel or similar before you import them to weed out models you wouldn't be interested in.
